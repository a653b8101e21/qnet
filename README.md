# qnet
qnet is a vigenÃ¨re cipher based domain and network name generator

Use qnet to create an alternate universe of domain names for example where username SONY may be taken the name encoded with realm asgard (```sgty```) will likely be available. If ```sgty``` is taken then change your realm to something other than asgard, valhalla for example will return ```noyf```

## Explanation

```Tell your friends "Hey, if you need to get in touch with me just message eve on qnet you'll find me in asgard```

```eve``` being a three letter combination is certainly taken but when used in conjunction with a qnet realm it maybe possible to clame it.

## Example

Examples of transforming the name eve through various qnet realms:

qnet america ```eve``` => ```ehi```

qnet valhalla  ```eve``` => ```zvp```

qnet asgard ```eve``` => ```enk```

qnet earth ```eve``` => ```ivv```

qnet universe ```eve``` => ```yim```


Name ```eve``` will certainly be taken, but encodings ```ehi```, ```zvp```, ```enk```, ```ivv```, ```yim``` could very well be available.

## Caveat Emptor

Where ```eve``` is a simple name to remember, with qnet there is another piece to memorize, the name of the realm where that person resides.

 In my opinion qnet://eve@valhalla is more human than eve2

 qnet://eve@valhalla

## Installation

npm i -g qnet

## CLI Usage

create a new domain named sony in the realm of asgard

```bash
qnet asgard sony
```
always returns the name
```sgty```
when paired with the realm of asgard
